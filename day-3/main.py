## IF-ELSE Statement
## if condition:
##     do this 
## else:
##     do this 

## Example:
# print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
# height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

# if height >= 120:
#     print("You can ride the rollercoaster! :)")
# else:
#     print("You cannot ride the rollercoaster! :(")

## Comparision Operators:
## > Greater than
## < Less than
## >= Greater than or equal to
## <= Less than or equal to
## == equal to
#// != not equal to

## Exercise 1:

# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

#     print("This is an even number.")
# else:
#     print("This is an odd number.")

## Exercise-2:
## Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
## It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
## Under 18.5 they are underweight
## Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
## Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
## Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
## Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
# weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# bmi = round(weight / (height ** 2))

## Exercise-3:
## Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 
## A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.

## This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
## on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
## **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
## **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

## Exercise-5:
