## Exercise-1

# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
# Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
# DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.
# DO NOT write any print statements.
# This is the scoring criteria:
# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

# student_scores = {
#   "Harry": 81,
#   "Ron": 78,
#   "Hermione": 99, 
#   "Draco": 74,
#   "Neville": 62,
# }
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# #TODO-1: Create an empty dictionary called student_grades.
# student_grades = {}

# #TODO-2: Write your code below to add the grades to student_grades.ðŸ‘‡
# for key in student_scores:
#     name = key
#     score = student_scores[key]
#     if score >= 91:
#         grade = "Outstanding"
#     elif score >= 81:
#         grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
#     elif score >= 71:
#         grade = "Acceptable"
#     else:
